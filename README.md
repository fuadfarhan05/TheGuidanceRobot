# TheGuidanceRobot
I took on a challenge to see if I can create therapy sessions with ppython that users can follow and learn about themselves. I used python and created a program that was designed to output advice based on the issue the user will choose to work on. This is a very simple and effective way for individuals to get advice. This is a program meant to encourage users to take on the challenges of their mind and learn how to fix them. One of the main things that they will learn is that sometimes the answer they are looking for is within themselves. This program was designed for the user to improve and even come up with the answers of their life issues through the guidance of the program.
